    "here in this course. However, I want to take a moment and talk about the fundamentals of how computers store images, as\n",
    "this will be important for you both in your assignment and for anything else you might want to do with images. I'm going\n",
    "to focus here on a kind of image called a raster -- or bitmap -- image. A raster image is a reductionist approach to\n",
    "representation, and at a high level it segments an image into a two dimensional array, like a grid. In this grid each\n",
    "cell contains information, such as color, for a single pixel value, and the lines of the grid are imaginary and have no\n",
    "width to them. This means that raster images are rectangular, so they have a width, and a height, and the total number\n",
    "of pixels in a raster image are the number of rows times the number of columns. In this course we're only going to be\n",
    "talking about square pixels, but it's possible to have other shapes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method for representing images is as a series of vectors -- drawing primitives which describe the lines\n",
    "and fills which make up the image. Vector images are really quite powerful as they can be resized an infinite amount\n",
    "without losing resolution. Raster images, on the other hand, are much easier to create, especially if they come out of a\n",
    "device which has an imaging sensor like a camera or cell phone. I won't talk any more about vector images in this\n",
    "course, but I do want to dive into raster images, and I think the Jupyter notebook is the perfect place to do that.\n"
