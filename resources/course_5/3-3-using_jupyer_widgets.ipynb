    "Ok, we're towards the end of the course, and I want to introduce you to one more thing - Jupyterlab Widgets. Before I do\n",
    "that though, let's reflect a bit on what you've learned. The first week of the course I showed you some methods from\n",
    "software engineering -- specifically diagramming through class and interaction diagrams -- which I use to design\n",
    "software solutions. These methods are commonly used in large teams, and are helpful in thinking through the entities and\n",
    "relationships you want to represent in your software. Through this module we also practiced our object oriented\n",
    "programming skills in python, and you tackled the creation of our game playing bot, WordyPy, in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second week of the course we expanded beyond the python standard library, and learnt how to manipulate images\n",
    "using the python imaging library. All third party libraries are different, so we went a bit in depth here, covering both\n",
    "imaging fundamentals as well as the nuance of the PIL library itself. At the end of the week you tackled bringing image\n",
    "manipulation into the WordyPy game to detect the state of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in this week I introduced to you a new library, **tesseract**, which does optical character recognition. I\n",
    "showed how this library works both by itself and with the skills you already have with the python imaging library. In\n",
    "the assignment for this week you'll utilize tesseract in order to add state to the WordyPy game. Specifically, my game\n",
    "engine will send you partial game plays which it expects you to finish, and you need to detect whatever the current game\n",
    "state is in order to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we do all of that, I want to introduce you to a form of interactivity called Jupyter Widgets.\n"

    "results in an easy to use web system. However, if you played at all with the extra images I gave you at the end of the\n",
    "previous lecture then you have undoubtedly recognized that it can still be a bit of a pain to explore all of the\n",
    "different options you might want to try when working with images. Especially when coming up with bounding boxes for\n",
    "images, I find that this can be very slow to do in jupyter notebooks. What Jupyter widgets allow you to do, is move the\n",
